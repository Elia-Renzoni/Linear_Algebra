Linear Algebra Project


This program concerned the verification of the conjecture of Beal, Cramer and Collatz.

 * Beal -> Is verified when the basis - of the first member of the equation - is equal to the base of the second member of the equation  :
            a^x + b^y = c^z
            
* Collatz -> witch was developed with a recursive function, is verified when the sequence of integers number end with 1, on the basis of the following function : 

  if the initial number, insert by the users, is odd => f = n * 3 + 1
  if the initial number, insert by the users, is even => f = n / 2

* Cramer -> .
